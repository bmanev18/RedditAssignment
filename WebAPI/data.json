I created WASM app as internal tool for my company. I choosen WASM because app is working with confidential documents so it cannot leave the company network. Later I realized I also want to protect the code (dont want to comment reasons). I was thinking to obfuscate the code but I know its still not enough. Then I was thinking to convert to blazor server but dont want to waste time with migrating whole app to server. I dont know what I want I was just wondering if anyone would have idea how to handle this. Is there any way that that WASM would be just embedded to server? "}]}
